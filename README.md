### How to run the project

### How to execute tests
- Unit tests are in `src/app.test.js`.
- I set up the `expect(long.longest('The cow jumped over the moon.')).toBe('6 jumped');` on your console if you change the expectation you will see the error. Please note this is just a basic setup with time constrain to complete the exercise.
