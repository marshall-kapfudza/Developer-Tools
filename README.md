# Javascript Tools Developer Exercise

### Overview
 
A class with a method to return the length and longest words in a sentence. For example, “The cow jumped over the moon.” should return 6 and “jumped”.

### How to execute your tests
- Created unit tests in `src/app.test.js` to test that method.
- I set up the `expect(long.longest('The cow jumped over the moon.')).toBe('6 jumped');` on your console if you change the expectation you will see the error. Please note this is just a basic setup with time constrain to complete the exercise.
- I used `https://devhints.io/expectjs` to create two basic test.
